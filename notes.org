- Good news: We have data on share on migrant working in health for the whole UK, based on annual population survey.
- Bad news: Care needs, the questions in survey is daily activity that they cannot do in thier own, but only for 65+
  - We will leave out for now the people younger that report long term conditions.
- Lower bound for care is one hour per week UKHLS.
- We have information about who is helping them. We could in second step get the share of informal share.
- We have the share of migrants providing care (always informal or formal) and needing care.
- Klara will send me the the input life table data.
